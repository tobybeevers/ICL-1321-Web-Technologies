### Multi Choice Exam ###
Network Layer - OSI Model

### Assignment One ###
For this assessment, you will create a small accessible website containing rich media content using valid HTML & CSS and upload it to Google Classroom. You will record the site development in a journal which is to be maintained throughout the development process.
You will submit this assignment in two tasks or stages:

*Task 1 – Initial Designs*

You will prepare design documentation (storyboards and feature lists) which shows what the site will look like on mobile & desktop screens and what users can do on the site.
The proposed site must be accessible i.e.
1. Accessible across different hardware / software platforms i.e. responsive & standard compliant.
As a minimum, you should specify the look and behaviour of the site on a smartphone and a desktop / laptop computer. If you want to specify other
platforms e.g. tablets, print, you are advised to seek tutor advice on what is realistically achievable in the available timescales.
2. Accessible to users with various disabilities such as sight, hearing, motor control, learning difficulties. Examples of accessibility features could include
features to aid users using screen-readers, size and appearance of navigation features, colour combinations, choice of typefaces / fonts.

*Task 2 – Website and Journal*

The journal should be fully updated to record all of the development completed. It should contain clear evidence of iterative development, validation and
testing and match the state of the submitted website. If you have uncompleted items in your product backlog, you can comment on this at the end of the
journal.
