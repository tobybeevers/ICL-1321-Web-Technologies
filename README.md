# ICL-1321 Web Technologies #

**This is the beginning of my journey into Data Science and Programming, this READ ME is a record of module ICL-1321 Web Technologies, part of my APPLIED DATA SCIENCE DEGREE APPRENTICESHIP BSC (HONS). Feel free to take a look and use the files, more than happy to share and help people on their own journey.**

**The module was taken over all semesters and consisted of two part, the first being network concepts, understanding protocols and the OSI Model before we moved onto creating a website using CSS and HTML5**


### Part One ###
This was a 2hr closed book test to assess understanding of material covered throughout the module. There was a total of 50 marks across different types of questions, some multi choice and some essay style and the test weighting was 20% for the module.

### Part Two ###
For this assessment, we created a small accessible website containing rich media content using valid HTML & CSS, we also had to will record the site development in a journal which was to be maintained throughout the development process. We submitted this assignment in two stages:

*Task 1 – Initial Designs*

We prepared design documentation which is on the DESIGNS.md file, these show what the site will look like on mobile & desktop screens and what users can do on the site. The proposed site had to be accessible i.e.

1. Accessible across different hardware/software platforms i.e. responsive & standard compliant. As a minimum, we had to specify the look and behaviour of the site on a smartphone and a desktop/laptop computer. 
2. Accessible to users with various disabilities such as sight, hearing, motor control, learning difficulties. Examples of accessibility features could include features to aid users using screen-readers, size and appearance of navigation features, colour combinations, choice of typefaces/fonts.

*Task 2 – Website and Journal*

We started to create our Website learning CSS and HTML5 along the way, we also completed a journal to record all of the development completed. The journal had to contain clear evidence of iterative development, validation and testing and match the state of the submitted website. My journal is also avaible in JOURNAL.md
